# exploring_NYC_public_schools_result_scores_Python

This NYC project is part of my learning journey as a Data Analyst using Python on DataCamp.

The analysis performs NYC public schools' score results by borough level and performs the following tasks: 

1. Which NYC schools have the best Math results?
2. What are top-10 performing schools based on total SAT scores?
3. Which borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?
4. Which borough has the highest average-SAT scores in each subject area?
5. What are top-performing and low-performing schools in each borough by its SAT scores?
6. How SAT scores (standard deviation) differ across boroughs for each subject area
7. What is the correlation between the percent-tested and average-SAT scores at the borough level
8. Categorizing schools as high-performing compared to those categorized as low-performing in terms of the average percent-tested in each borough.
